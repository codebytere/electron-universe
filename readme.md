## Electron Universe

This is the Electron app I created as a slide deck for my talk about [Electron](https://electron.atom.io) at GitHub Universe 2017 (and [2016](https://github.com/zeke/electron-universe/tree/2016-version)).

To run it locally, with animations and links and whatnot:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/zeke/electron-universe
cd electron-universe
npm install
npm start
```
